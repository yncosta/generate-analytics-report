# Welcome to my portfolio repository! 

I will be using this repository to hold code and queries for portfolio projects that I run locally. Notebooks will be mainly stored in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yanscosta/code).
I hope you like what you see! Feel free to contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yanphcosta/).
